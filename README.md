# Berserk-Reffect
A more visible UI element for Warrior's Berserker Elite Specialization.

Due to limitations on how reffect tracks buffs, durations over 5 seconds cannot be tracked, so this bar will cap at 5 seconds, and display arrows if you are over the cap. This is intended to be used mostly for people learning the spec, to warn you about berserk mode extensions. While under 5 seconds, the bar will start to drain, and the berserk icon will pulse.

Also, due to a fairly common bug with mounting resetting the F2 skill, the bar has been kept at a size where it fits outside of Berserk mode, so that it doesn't overlap graphics if this bug ocurs. It also makes it fit snuggly when outside of berserk. Unfortunately, this is a game bug and thus, unless fixed by the devs, cannot be avoided.

Contains two options. Type 1 is based off of the revenant energy bar. Type 2 is a more simplified version.

# Type 1

# How to use
Simply download the zip file to your reffect root folder like so:

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs. To select which type you want to use, expand the Berserk pack and enable / disable Type 1 or 2:

# Notes

This effect is made with Normal interface size. If you use a different one, you can resize all the elements at once by right-clicking on the pack and selecting resize. Alternatively, you can move the pack's position on screen if needed, though it should be aligned by default.
